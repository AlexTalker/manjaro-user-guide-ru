A note about Manjaro and Arch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manjaro is based on another distribution called Arch Linux.
 As such, it is also able to draw software packages from the community-maintaine
d Arch User Repository (AUR).
 However, please note that Manjaro is not Arch, and any enquieries about
 the Manjaro operating system should be directed towards the Manjaro forums
 and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels alone.
 For example, although Ubuntu is derived from Debian - and therefore shares
 some similarities with its parent - there are still substantial differences
 between these operating systems and how they work.
 Such is the case with Manjaro, which is far from just being an

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Arch operating system.
 Here are some of the key differences between the Manjaro and Arch operating
 systems: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is developed independently from Arch, and by a completely different
 team.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro is designed to be accessible to newcomers, while Arch is aimed at
 experienced users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro draws software from its own independent repositories.
 These repositories also contain software packages not provided by Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro provides its own distribution-specific tools such as the Manjaro
 Hardware Detection (MHWD) utility, and the Manjaro Settings Manager (MSM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manjaro has numerous subtle differences in how it works when compared to
 Arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reiterate, although Manjaro is indeed an Arch-derivative, it is not Arch!

About Manjaro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Manjaro
\series default
 is a user-friendly 
\series bold
GNU/Linux
\series default
 distribution based on the independently developed 
\series bold
Arch Linux
\series default
.
 Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally
 fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the
 very latest cutting-edge software.
 However, Arch is also traditionally aimed at more experienced or technically-mi
nded users.
 As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of many, especially
 those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developed in Austria, France, and Germany, Manjaro aims to provide all of
 the benefits of Arch Linux combined with a focus on user-friendliness and
 accessibility.
 Available in both 32- and 64-bit versions, Manjaro is suitable for newcomers
 as well as experienced Linux users.
 For newcomers, a user-friendly installer is provided, and the system itself
 is designed to work fully

Downloading Manjaro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
32- and 64-bit versions of Manjaro are available for download as a disc
 image.
 Disc images available for 32-bit systems will end in
\series bold
 i686.iso
\series default
 and images for 64-bit systems will end in 
\series bold
x86_64.iso
\series default
.
 A 64-bit operating system won't run on a 32-bit system, and although a
 32-bit operating system will run on a 64-bit system it won't be able to
 make full use of its resources.
 Try to make sure that you download the appropriate disc image for your
 system!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Manjaro editions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two editions of Manjaro available for download:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Full
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

edition This edition of Manjaro comes complete with a pre-installed desktop
 environment.
 In the case of the XFCE edition, it will also come with a selection of
 popular software applications.
 This would be the most appropriate choice for those who wish to try out
 Manjaro on a Live-CD 
\begin_inset Flex Marginnote
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When you purchase retail software it generally comes on a disc, whether
 a CD or a DVD.
 A 'Live-CD' has a version of the operating system that will run without
 needing to be installed.
 This is a feature of most GNU/Linux and BSD-based operating systems.
\end_layout

\end_inset

without having to install it first.
 An ISO image for a full edition of Manjaro will list the pre-installed
 desktop environment in its name.
 For example, a disc image beginning with
\series bold
 manjaro-xfce
\series default
 will have the XFCE desktop environment pre-installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

NET
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

edition This edition of Manjaro provides only a base installation, stripped
 of all but the most basic pre-installed software.
 Starting from the command line, this is suitable for more experienced users
 who may wish to build their own Manjaro systems from the ground up.
 A disc image for a NET edition will always begin with 
\series bold
manjaro-net
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Downloading a disc image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each stable release and test-build of Manjaro has its own particular download
 location which will contain all the available 32- and 64-bit versions for
 both the full and NET editions.
 Each location will also contain the relevant checksum files which can be
 used to check the integrity of your downloaded disc image file (i.e.
 to ensure that it has not been corrupted during download).
 A guide to doing this included in the following section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Stable
\begin_inset space ~

Releases of Manjaro are intended to be used by the general public.
 As such, this will be the appropriate choice for the majority of users.
 Each of the stable releases - starting from 0.8.0 - can be downloaded from

\begin_layout Standard
Before burning your downloaded disc image (or using it as a virtual disc
 in Virtualbox), we strongly recommend that you first check that it hasn't
 been corrupted.
 The potential result of not doing so, especially if you want to install
 Manjaro as your main operating system, should be obvious.
 In the best case, the installation will fail.
 In the worst case a corrupted image will result in a corrupted installation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify the integrity of the disc image you have to download the appropriate
 checksum file.
 This will be available at the same place where you downloaded the disc
 image file.
 The file 
\series bold
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt 
\series default
contains checksum hashes for all the available ISO files and will have content
 similar to this:

\begin_layout Section
MD5 and SHA-1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have seen there are two checksum files.
 One ends -sha1sum.txt, the other ends -md5sum.txt.
 MD5 and SHA are two types of hashing algorithms; the 'sha' part of the
 checksum file name stands for 
\series bold
Secure Hash Algorithm
\series default
.
 These algorithms are used to generate a hash code unique to the disc image
 file.
 The checksum file itself is just a text document that contains hash codes
 that should match the code generated by the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithm.
 Copies of the file can be checked to make sure they are exactly the same
 - if the file is changed in any way, either intentionally or by corruption,
 the code generated will be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst MD5 is commonly used, SHA-1 is newer and more secure and is beginning
 to replace MD5.
 For the purpose of checking the integrity of the downloaded file MD5 is
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good enough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but SHA-1 is a better solution.
 The checking process is the same for both algorithms.
 We recommend you use SHA-1.
 For more about hashing algorithms Wikipedia has lots of information.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the code generated from the disc image matches that contained in the
 checksum file, then the disc image file is fine.
 If the two codes don't match then it means that the disc image file has
 changed in some way, most likely due to being corrupted.
 You can think of it like someone using a password to identify who they
 are: if they provide the wrong password, then something is probably wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this point on we'll assume you are using the file 
\series bold
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt
\series default
.
\begin_inset Flex Marginnote
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Test builds have a slightly different arrangement.
 Instead of a single file with all checksums, each ISO file has its own
 associated checksum file.
 If you're running the test build I'm sure you can work it out!
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Checking in Linux
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatic verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program 
\family typewriter
sha1sum 
\family default
can automatically compare the checksum of the disc image you downloaded
 against the value in the text file.
 The process is very straightforward, but the end result might look a little
 worrying!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this example, I first open a terminal and change to the directory where
 I downloaded the disc image file and checksum file.
 I use the command 
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 to check which files are present:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~$ cd download
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~/download$ ls
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt  manjaro-xfce-0.8.9-x86_64.iso
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see I have downloaded the 64-bit XFCE edition.
 Next, I run the 
\family typewriter
sha1sum
\family default
 program to check against the values in the checksum file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
jonathon@box:~/download$ sha1sum -c manjaro-0.8.9-sha1sum.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next set of lines show the result of the checks.
 While the first few lines look worrying this is to be expected - the program
 can't check disc image files that aren't there! The second to last line
 is the important one.
 It shows that 
\family typewriter
sha1sum
\family default
 has successfully verified the disc image I downloaded against the checksum
 value in the file.

Then you can generate an SHA-1 hash code for the ISO image using:

This command generates a hash code for the 64-bit Manjaro XFCE 0.8.9 disc
 image which can then be manually compared to the code contained in the
 checksum file.

Unlike Linux, Microsoft Windows does not have any suitable built-in tools
 so you will need to download and install a checksum utility application.
 A web search will turn up several examples of free software, or you can
 look on the

Once you have downloaded the checksum utility, the checking process is very
 straightforward.
 Simply 
\series bold
Browse

 to the downloaded ISO file, select it, and click

 The program will then calculate the checksums for the disc image file.

To speed up the process it's probably a good idea to deselect the hashes

\end_layout

 To verify the checksum is correct, open the 
\series bold

\series default
 in a text editor such as Notepad, copy the checksum for the disc image
 file you have downloaded, and paste it into the verification box.
 Then click

 If there are no problems with the disc image file the program will inform
 you that the hash matched.

A disc image is not a copy-and-paste duplication of files: it's a bit-for-bit
 copy of the raw data that makes up the files and folders of that disc.
 This is why just copying a disc image file to a disc (or USB flashdrive)
 to begin installing won't work: you'll need to use a disc burning or image
 writing application to translate that raw data into the files and folders.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is an exception to this rule.
 If you intend on installing Manjaro in a virtual machine environment using
 Oracle's Virtualbox, then there will be no need to burn the image as Virtualbox
 will be able to read from the ISO file directly as a virtual disc.

Once converted, the files can be used to run Manjaro in Live-CD mode without
 having to install it to your system, and/or install Manjaro on your system.
 It's important to note Manjaro will not have full functionality when run
 in Live-CD mode.
 For example, you will not be able to save any changes to the system, install
 updates or add new applications.

Re-partitioning your USB stick as a RAW data type will result in all data
 present being destroyed, and will render it unusable for other purposes

If for some reason the writing process is unsuccessful the ImageWriter authors
 recommend that you use a partitioning tool to reformat the USB flash drive
 as a RAW partition type, then try again.
 Unfortunately this process is outside the scope of this guide.

Booting the Live environment, whether from CD/DVD or USB flash drive, will
 give you an overview of the Manjaro Linux environment and let you test
 how well it will run on your machine.
 This is very useful to check before committing to install a new operating
 system!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For best results you should be connected to the Internet.
 If you have a wired Ethernet connection, and plug in before booting the
 Live environment, Manjaro will automatically set up a connection.
 If you have a wireless (Wi-Fi) connection you can set up the wireless network
 once you have reached the Manjaro desktop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of selecting the boot device varies considerably across machines.
 You may need to hold one key, for example <
\series bold
Esc
\series default
>, <
\series bold
Del
\series default
>, or <
\series bold
F10
\series default
>, to select the boot device.
 Or, you may need to set the option in your BIOS.
 If you're not sure, your machine's user guide will have detail of the method
 you need, alternatively a web search will also quickly turn up the answer.

The boot menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you boot from your installation media (CD/DVD or USB flash drive) you
 should be presented with the Manjaro boot screen.
 This screen provides several options to help get the best experience from
 the Live environment.

Choosing the drivers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main sets of drivers that can be used by Manjaro: 
\series bold
Free
\series default
 and 
\series bold
non-Free
\series default
.
 The differences are not minor, and your choice can depend on your computer
 hardware.
\begin_inset Flex Marginnote

Free

drivers.
 If you want to play games, choose 
\series bold

\series default
 drivers.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
Free
\series default
 drivers are open-source, like Manjaro itself, written and updated by a
 large community.
 For older hardware and that with Intel-based integrated graphics, this
 is the best choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
Non-Free
\series default
 drivers are closed-source, written and updated only by the hardware manufacture
rs.
 This is generally the best choice for newer hardware with AMD or Nvidia
 dedicated graphics.
 At the time of writing, 
\series bold
non-Free
\series default
 drivers are the best choice for Nvidia graphics and AMD graphics newer
 than the 8000-series.
 For older AMD and Nvidia hardware the 
\series bold
Free
\series default
 drivers work very well.
 For AMD graphics older than the HD5000-series 
\series bold
Free
\series default
 drivers are the best choice.

UEFI is the commonly agreed on name for both the EFI & UEFI standards which
 merged.
 It does not include the old EFI v1, or Apple's own non-standard version
 of EFI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a relatively new computer (e.g.
 post-2012) it will probably have UEFI support; it certainly will if it
 came with Microsoft Windows 8 or later installed.
 At this point in time, installing a Linux distribution on a UEFI system
 can be tricky.
 Thankfully Manjaro's installer, Thus, does a good job of correctly setting
 up everything.
 However, there are still important considerations, especially when it comes
 to the partitioning table.

Once you have booted the system from the Live CD/USB you will be presented
 with the Manjaro boot selection screen.
 It has two main options for the drivers it will use (either Free or non-Free).
 The main difference is the lack of any option for language or keyboard
 layout.
 However, this is actually not that important! When you run Thus and choose
 your language and keyboard layout this will take effect within the Live
 environment, along with setting these for the installed system.

 The main difference is in the partition layout: this is important if you
 wish to manually partition the drive to suit your own requirements.

 they will become 
\series bold
orphan
\series default
 packages.
 These serve no function other than taking up space! To remove a software
 package with its dependencies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rs leafpad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A package may also create configuration files.
 Normally these are left in place so your configuration is not lost, and
 can be reused if you install the package again.
 However, if you want to remove these configuration files too, the command
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rns leafpad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at a later date you want to remove all orphan packages and configuration
 files for packages that you removed some time ago, the following command
 will do it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be warned, though: this is an advanced command!

Other pacman commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good idea to become familiar with the pacman commands.
 It can be a very useful tool in case the other software managers refuse
 to complete an installation, for example if an installation process is
 interrupted.

\begin_layout Section
Updating the mirror list
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manjaro Linux packages are hosted on a number of servers across the world;
 these servers 
\series bold
mirror
\series default
 the official Manjaro software repository.
 When you first install Manjaro it will try to work out which server is
 closest to you so that software downloads complete as quickly as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, though, the list of mirrors can get old.
 New mirrors can become available, and some mirrors are removed.
 Updates to Manjaro will regularly trigger an update of the mirror list,
 but sometimes it's useful to do this manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To update the mirror list use the following command:

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will test the speed of all currently available mirrors and set your
 machine to use the best for you.
 Once this command has completed, you should force a download of the package
 lists:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Switching branches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you install Manjaro you will be using the stable branch.
 This set of packages has the most testing and so is the best for most users.
 However, you may want to help test packages before they move to the stable
 repository:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The testing repository has packages that have been checked by the Manjaro
 development team to make sure they work correctly.
 However, the amount of testing done is much smaller than for the stable
 branch - but this is how they get tested!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can switch to the unstable
 branch.
 This is normally used by the Manjaro developers.
 Packages from the unstable branch can cause problems, so this is not something
 to do lightly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b unstable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After switching branches you will need to force an update of the package
 lists:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syyu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you switch away from the stable branch, but want to move back, it's actually
 pretty easy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman-mirrors -g -b stable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will leave the newer packages on your system and these will be replaced
 as the stable branch catches up.
 However, if you want to force a downgrade of packages back to the stable
 version, use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
sudo pacman -Syyuu
